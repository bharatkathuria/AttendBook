# AttendBook
AttendBook - Smart Attendance Application built for GGSIPU university as part of my minor project...

Android, Java
---->  An Android Application, which provides the teacher with an
efficient way of take students attendance and increase the
transparency between teacher and students.
----> The teacher can take the attendance within the university premises
only as outside the premises application restricts them to take
attendance but can perform normal functions.
--> Implemented the location feature using Google Geo-fence API and
running background service for location monitoring and it stores
and retrives data from Firebase .
